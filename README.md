# SOFE3980U-Lab1

This project is to create a binary object class that can do simple logical functions with binary numbers such as AND, OR, ADD, or MULT. 
The project also contains an app class that allows a user to interact with the binary class
The object class is then tested for errors with the test cases from the test folder
